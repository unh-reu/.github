## REU: Sensors in Earth, Oceans, and Space Science – How We Observe Our Planet

An REU is a “Research Experience for Undergraduates,” program sponsored by the National Science Foundation. 
The goal of all REU programs is to provide authentic research experiences for undergraduate students. 
We aim to help students identify if STEM majors and careers are right for them. 
Our primary goal is to provide a positive introduction to sensor-based Earth and space science research for underserved student populations.

Research opportunities in Earth, Oceans, and Space focuses on sensors used across many fields of Earth, Space and Ocean sciences. 
This REU program is hosted by UNH’s Institute for the Study of Earth, Oceans, and Space, providing research projects and mentors in all three of these scientific fields.
We focus on sensors and cutting-edge data science skills to learn to harness the data revolution! 

In this REU, you will develop skills to collect, analyze, and interpret data from a wide range of sensors used in science. This includes sensors deployed in ocean settings, forests, rivers, and even satellites in space. Data analysis using programming and statistics are core skills taught by leading scientists.
Professional development activities: In addition to learning scientific research skills, you will present a research poster to peer researchers at a multi-internship end of summer symposium. This REU will also provide weekly lunch discussions with scientific professionals in academia, industry, and government, giving you a chance to learn about the myriad career pathways opened by STEM degrees.
Open to students of all levels and majors: This REU is open to undergraduate students of all levels and majors, including undecided/undeclared majors.

Each student will work on a specific project with a faculty mentor. See below for project descriptions and mentor profiles. Over the course of 10 weeks, you will learn about the research questions that can be addressed by the type of sensors used in your mentor’s lab, how to collect, maintain, and analyze data, and finally how to present your findings to peers. Many projects will involve computer programming skill building, and some will include field and/or lab work. You will also learn about data stewardship, research integrity, and collaborative science. REU students will work alongside graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and other scientific professionals.

The program is located at The University of New Hampshire main campus in Durham, NH. All REU students  have housing on campus, and mentor labs are all in UNH’s Institute for the Study of Earth, Oceans, and Space. Some projects may involve field work off-campus; transportation will be provided for all required fieldwork.
